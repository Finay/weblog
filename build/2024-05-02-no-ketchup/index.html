<h1>log001: No Ketchup</h1>
<p>
2024.5.2 11:11 am. Continuing from Log000, it turns out I didn't need the whole 90 minutes. I got by with 60 minutes of
dozing off on 3 plastic chairs put together in the LRC. I feel bad for the cleaning lady that came through and had to
find me like that. I didn't get to doing work yesterday though. I played some badminton with Ms. Nguyen after that,
biked home in the rain, slacked off, ate, slept. Work at 3:35 this morning to write up enough of the english essay to
get through today. The essays a satire on programmer culture, the twist is that the entire essay is written in the form
of API docs for a library to program a programmer. Very esoteric but it got through a soir√©e reading this morning.
Synbio presentation went fine also. Didn't get around to my linkedin stuff, but I guess that'll be for later today.
Ebony Eyes of Songs in the Key of Life by Stevie Wonder came on, cool instruments. Ignoring APs, things between me and
working on my gap year are finishing the essay, outlining another presentation, and withdrawing apps. I hope I can
finish all three today. At least finish the essay. I could technically skip the others before doing gap year research.

2024.5.2 7:12 pm. I'm home now. The rest of the school day honestly went perfect now that I think about it.
Entrepreneurship class was basically one long conversation with Jake Chon. It had a good balance of talking about life
and talking about our two projects, so I didn't feel worked while feeling productive. Lunch was Fatteh. Basically a
salad on steroids, still vegetarian though (that orange sauce is so damn good). Talked with Noah Chie after eating,
felt good to catch up with him, I don't get too many conversations with just him and I. I slept on the field in the sun
for my free. Didn't do much from 3 to 5 but got to bike with Aki on the way back. Some train riding and essay writing
later, here I am. First time in three days I was able to work after getting home instead of slacking off on the bed or
something. Possibly a habit I need to keep up if I want to get anywhere during my gap year.
