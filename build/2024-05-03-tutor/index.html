2024.05.03 7:17 am. Listening to New Magic Wand by Tyler the creator. I have my headphones on. Not my earbuds. They're
heavy but the noise-cancelling is worth it. Last night, I was up till 1:30 am tutoring my brother on physics. He's
struggling in the class. I know he's smart. I think he's just shaped into thinking otherwise. Pretty sure my parents
make him reflect on every grade below a PH or something and give him journaling practice and talk to teachers of
whatever classes they think he's struggling in. I swear it's just better to trust that he'll get whatever grades he
wants to get. At this point, they're just telling him he can't get them on his own. Anyway, I was busy doing that, so
I have some catching up to do today but that isn't anything new, is it?

2024.05.03 4:58 pm. I forgot to run today. I finished my linkedin message though. And I started looking for jobs.
Midway through I spoke to Sasha Fujiwara. I knew he was hella impressive, but I learned so much more about him from that
conversation. Happened to get some contacts from him that may be interesting. Good refuel of motivation but I took the
afterschool easy. Just played some poker with Alec Ondo, haven't in a while and man it was fun. I think the plan is to
maybe get a snack on the way home, keep good routines, and sleep well to get the 6 am wake for the first time on a
weekend. For the weekend, I think I narrow down priorities to AP study and job search only. Oh yea, and I'm at a jazz
concert at school right now. One of the few events where I actually came to watch as an audience instead of filming
as ASIJTV. Feels good. I needed this laid back Friday.
