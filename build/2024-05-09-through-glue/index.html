<h1>log005: Through Glue</h1>
<p>
2024.05.09 11:14 am. I think it would be fun to create weekly goals and recaps of progress. Hopefully, I can start this
    weekend. For now, I am just bogged with so much stuff. I know it's getting really repetitive to complain about the
    amount of work I have due, but just putting it out there is helping me get through. I have about 3 hours of work
    left today assuming I can keep full energy and motivation. Top priority to replying to a linkedin message. Beyond
    that, I want around 50 minutes of AP study and spend all else on other opportunity planning work. IGNORE ALL
    HOMEWORK UNTIL THE WEEKEND.
