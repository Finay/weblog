<h1>Overdue scrubbing</h1>
<p>
    A few weeks before mountain day (sometime mid-August) in 2023, my dad suggested I clean up a pair of old hiking
    boots to resell for some pocket money. His thinking was that people would want to hike for mountain day, and it
    would be easier to sell the shoes then. I said I'll do it.
    <br/><br/>
    Two mountain days had passed without that pair ever leaving the closet. It wasn't purely out of forgetfulness. I had
    "clean shoes" written across at least 3 of the almost half a dozen todolist-getmylifetogether-organizer-systems I
    made for myself between the two mountain days. From early 2024, "clean shoes" didn't just mean my hiking shoes. On
    more than one occasion, I would return home through the rain and notice the fabric of my white sneakers age into an
    uneven gray. I liked these shoes. I knew I should treat them better.
    <br/><br/>
    Today, after almost 400 days, I got back from my morning workout and just decided I was going to finish what I've
    put off for so long. In my mind, it wasn't really about the fact I put it off for so long. I just got back and saw
    my shoes and thought that they needed cleaning. It didn't take much convincing, or more like I needed to be
    convinced out of it to not do it, but there wasn't really an argument for that.
    <br/><br/>
    I ended up scrubbing all pairs of shoes I owned from my flip-flops to the hiking boots. I look forward to wearing
    them once they dry.
