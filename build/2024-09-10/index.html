<h1>Off to college?</h1>
<p>
    As I write this, I'm in a classroom at the Tokyo Technical College (TTC, a stemmy vocational school), enjoying the
    irony of coming to a school
    while being on a gap year. It's also just around the same time most friends from my grade started their classes too.
    I'm not exactly here as a student though, I'm actually here as a teachers assistant to Paul Li of Terakoya AI, who
    helps teach some classes here, and who I've been interning for over the past year or so. I got the internship
    through Mr. Suzuki at ASIJ and worked on stuff from managing the site towards the beginning of the internship to AI
    related projects more recently. As a part of that, I took on designing a week-long hackathon type course for a class
    of first and second years in the data science and AI track at TTC.
    <br/><br/>
    I went through a lot of ideas about what would be fun and practical for them and settled on having them learn to use
    the OpenAI and Discord API to build an accessible AI based tool. The class is primarily in Japanese, so I wrote up a
    bunch of guides in English and Paul helped translate them over.
    <br/><br/>
    On the train heading to TTC on my first day, I had all the worries about making the objective too hard or too easy,
    lacking guides, the students not enjoying it, etc. But oddly enough the fear of having to interact with people in
    Japanese was really quiet. Even walking into the classroom, the roots of my nervousness consisted only of feeling a
    little out of place and seeing a group of new people. It was nice not being able to remember how my attitude towards
    speaking Japanese made me nervous while merely looking for a part-time job.
    <br/><br/>
    The class has 17 students. Many of them were internation from other parts of Asia, coming to TTC right after
    spending 2 years in a Japanese language school. Some were my age, others were over a decade older. From the
    icebreakers, many of them liked rice over ramen. I was a part of the ramen group, joining the discussion talking
    about our favorite ramen types and such. From it, I'm starting to believe a little more that I can pull off
    a part-time job. Though, after seeing the students, my feelings of wanting them to enjoy and gain a lot out of the
    challenge I designed grew with its accompanying worries, but I guess that's a matter of how well I can support them
    for the rest of the week.
    <br/><br/>
    I said yesterday that I'll set some milestones to help measure 3 of my goals. I don't feel a need for long
    explanations so here they are in bullet points.
<ul>
    <li>College: Draft essays for one application (DL: 2024/9/17)</li>
    <li>AI Studies: Comprehend 2 approaches to music generation (DL: 2024/9/17)</li>
    <li>Setting Out: Register for a one day job (DL: 2024/9/14) and apply for a regular part-time job (DL: 2024/9/17)
    </li>
</ul>
