<h1>Sept - Mar, a pessimistic recap</h1>
<p>
    Apologies to my loyal readers for the half a year blank in my entries, but trust me, it's not like I finished much
    in that time. With the Shimanami trip and week without internet, I didn't keep up with the writing and I didn't get
    around to resuming it after I got back. I know it's one sorry excuse and I would have had a happier time had I
    continued writing but that's not how things played out. Welpers, now to catch you up on a few highlights from
    mid-September to today. Early October had a few tech gatherings: I attended the Gemma conference by Google (whoa
    they rich, I got free food and venue went crazy) and Pycon Tokyo (I got a pycharm pin XD). I went in excited, I left
    kinda empty. I knew I was gonna be a random high schooler among pretty senior ppl but like, I felt so useless. I
    learned a few things but couldn't really socialize or anything. Just realized I got a long ways to go and that was
    kinda depressing. The rest of October was full of cafe visits in an attempt to write college essays (emphasis on the
    "in an attempt"). It was a lonely month, I kept up some running but I should have found new things to do with my
    time. I did intend on getting a job this month but that didn't play out either :(. November started with attending a
    ML research confrence. Pretty much the same takeaway as the October gatherings... I also started getting essay help,
    very expensive essay help. I did need it. I got to visit a friend in Karuizawa in the middle of the month. Probably
    Novembers highlight. Short trip but was the first time in almost 2 months I got to hang out with someone. Beside a
    little Hakone trip in late November, each day was just "essay work" or sessions with my tutor. Went to Winterfest in
    early December. Kinda sucked, not something wrong with ASIJ or friends there, just I didn't know what I wanted to do
    there. Quite a selfish way to experience things but just how I was that day. The weeks following were dedicated to
    college essays, still no job, essays still piling up. Got to see a few friends over Winter break and did a little cs
    side project. 2025 started rough with apps deadlines finally slamming. It wasn't a very healthy time for me and I
    didn't even finish all the apps I intended to do but by the end of January, it was over. Full transparency, the task I
    was "drowning in" since September probably took 30-40 hours of work total. After apps, to no ones surprise, I was the
    same person. No newfound freedom or discipline from apps being off my shoulders. I did start a journal though. Not
    like I was super consistent, but I wrote stuff here and there. Maybe placebo but I felt happier. I got a job as a
    mover for Sakai by the end of the month, many months late but slow motion is better than no motion. Maybe I'll write
    about the moving job in a dedicated post cuz I had a lot of experiences from the few weeks on the job but one short
    rundown is actually working is a fair bit more fulfilling than rotting in the same room all day. Feb finished with
    a family trip to Ise and visiting a friend in Nagano (hard offs forever!) and on March 3rd, I left Tokyo for a month
    long southeast Asia trip. Currently, on day 3 waiting in a cafe for an overnight bus out of Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
    Thailand. Maybe I'll resume consistent updates, maybe I won't. I'm bad with promises so can't say anything but uhh
    yeah... thanks for reading.
