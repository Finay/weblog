<h1>(SEAT2025) Food Log #1</h1>
<p>
    I'm 8 days into Thailand and I've tried all sorts of foods. I've missed out on a bunch cuz I lack the guts to just
    go for some market stands but I've still got to try a decent variety of foods. Tossing a bunch of general photos I
    took so far here but this post is actually dedicated to the second to last photo: the Gaeng Hung Lay.
    <br/><br/>

    My first street meal on day 1 after a day without a proper meal (cuz I don't count plane food ew). Kuushinsai stir fry and
    pad thai. Was very good.<br/>
    <img src="/weblog/static/images/my%20pad%20thai.JPG"/>
    Pad thai I made in a chiang mai cooking class.<br/>
    <img src="/weblog/static/images/my%20pranang%20curry.png"/>
    Pranang curry I made. Kinda a mellower peanuts curry. Liked it very much.<br/>
    <img src="/weblog/static/images/my%20tom%20yum.JPG"/>
    Tom yum. Classic hot and sour soup.<br/>

    When this first came, I was kinda like, this is all I got for 130 baht? (cuz 130 baht gets you like 2 full meals
    most of the time). Then I took one bite of the curry with pork and was in heaven. The pork was softened to the
    perfect point and the soup hit the spiciness sweet spot (well at least for my spiciness intolerant tongue). Bread
    was average but paired well with the curry and godamn I wanna be able to make this. Oh and this was today (day 8)
    <br/>

    Dinner for today, pork rind things with chili dip. I had absolutely no clue how to eat this and was probably
    embarassing myself trying to make little lettuce wraps of rice, pork, and chili dip but like, cmon I was enjoying
    the food with a live street singing dude :)<br/>
