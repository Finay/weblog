<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hey there, I'm Kian Benner, a high school graduate as of June 2024 on a gap year. I like running, sleeping, and
    computers. I taught myself Python in 8th grade and have been making all sorts of little projects since, this blog
    being one of them. My goal is to be working with new ideas in artificial intelligence, so I'm currently learning
    different things and taking on different experiences towards becoming an AI researcher.
</p>

<h1>What's This?</h1>
<p>
    This blog is meant to be a place where I can share things I've learned, upcoming plans, progress, and other thoughts
    throughout my gap year, so I can keep motivated and practice public learning. I hope I can find some people
    interested in what I am doing and make new friends along my journey or help others doing similar things. Also, I
    just wanted to say that the plain look to the site is an artistic choice, I am perfectly capable of making it
    colorful and fancy if I wanted to.
</p>
