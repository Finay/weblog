<h1>log000: The Drop</h1>
<p>
2024.5.1 3:37 am. I just spent the past 2 hours setting up this blog. It really wasn't meant to be hard,
but I refused to read the tutorial I was following, so I learned jekyll's post filename format the hard way.
That's besides the point though. I am writing this post because I withdrew my biggest college applications 3 hours ago.
In other words, I'm committed to taking a gap year and reapplying next year. It's the first thing
I've done towards a gap year that I can't turn back from. I think I needed that but honestly, I'm also scared.

2024.5.1 10:31 am. In my economics class now. I should be studying for the AP test in 6 days, but I have an
interview with the school director of technology in 26 minutes. Then, a linear algebra/multivar calc test as soon as
that ends. I didn't study yet. I'm on 2.5 hours of sleep. I graduate in a month. Exactly a month.

2024.5.1 2:18 pm. I'm in my statistics class listening to Hyperdrama by Justice. It's raining, and I don't want to do
anything. I struggled on the math test. I don't even know if I managed to answer half the questions. Others said the
same thing, but I probably shouldn't care what they say. I'll maybe try to feel motivated to do better next time.

2024.5.1 2:58 pm. I have craploads of work I want done, need done. I'm taking a gap year. I need to figure out what that
means for me. I need time to figure out what I can do. But by tomorrow, I need to finish an essay, prep a presentation,
and message some people on linkedin. By Tuesday, I need to outline another presentation, withdraw all other college
apps and be ready for APs. School is silly. A part of me thinks the work I do for it is pointless compared to getting
my gap year going, but I don't have the guts to just drop my schoolwork like that. So, I'm going to torture myself by
doing both. Let me do the math, I think it's possible. I can finish my essay in 2 hours, prep the presentation in 30
minutes, write the message in 15. I want a 90-minute nap, so I can actually function. 4h 15min. I think I have the time.
Wish me luck.
