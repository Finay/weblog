<h1>log004: Renovation One</h1>
<p>
2024.05.08 3:57 pm. It's been a while. I've been busy studying for aps and renovating the blog, though noone would
    really notice the fact that it went through a huge upgrade. I realized I wouldn't be able to customize the theme and
    things if I kept with the jekyll layout, and I knew I could make my own setup if I tried, so I just went for it.
    Can't say it was exactly easy. Automating the table of contents generation would have been tricky on its own since
    I didn't want to use a database to store the posts requiring post data to be stored in the html files and read by
    the server. But I need to do that while being able to generate a static version of the site as github pages only
    serves static files. I coded most of my own version of those features before realizing flatpages exists and learning
    that was a whole other adventure. Anyway, that took up my time the past couple of days, and it really feels great to
    be back coding again. On top of that, I had aps. I took stats and micro yesterday. The back to back was tough, and
    I don't think there is a way to train for sitting at a table for 6 hours straight. I think I did decently well. At
    the very least, I answered all questions. I only have macro left happening in two days. Today, I want to finish up
    the blog's about page (maybe add a formal non-log post), study for ap macro, finish yet another linkedin thing, go
    on a run, and flesh out more of my job hunting plan. Kind of ambitious but feeling pretty good so mind as well take
    advantage of that.
