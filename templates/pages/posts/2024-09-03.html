<h1>A fresh start on day 94</h1>
<p>
    First of all, I think I owe an apology to anyone who has been following this blog and had to be dissapointed at the
    lack of updates. Counting from graduation, I'm 94 days into my gap year. So what have I been up to? Well, in early
    June, I made visits to ASIJ to help out the iGEM team. One day in late June, I broke into my house with some friends
    when I locked myself out. I also missed a senior trip to being sick. I visited a friend in Nagano for a week as July
    started, and together we almost peaked Mt. Fuji, "almost" since we underestimated the climate and overestimated the
    departure time of the final bus back down the mountain. After getting back, I won a game hackathon. Then in August,
    I climbed Mt. Hijiri, Japan's southernmost mountain over 3,000m, with my Dad and Brother. For the rest of the month
    I picked up my AI studies watching Andrej Karpathy videos and getting to the point I could understand the "Attention
    is all you need" paper (kinda proud of that).
<br/><br/>
    It was a good summer, but looking at myself at this point, I don't think I have much to show for being 94 days into
    a gap year. Don't get me wrong, each of those events were wonderful but the days and weeks between were pretty much
    void of progress. Going into the gap year, I knew these first few months were the most important to figure out and
    organize the rest of the year, but if you asked me right now what my plan is for my gap year I'd dodge the question
    with some reply along the lines of "Oh I'm trying to figure out how I can travel somewhere, probably Denmark". I
    don't even have a job lined up or any concrete destination with my "AI studies". Especially with college apps coming
    around (for the second time), I needed an elegant answer, not some ineffable gut feeling, to "Why did I take a gap
    year".
<br/><br/>
    Luckily, I can get part of the answer from this very situation. I lack initiative. I think it's apparent from how I
    spent my free time this summer and even at school my level of dedication I would put out was far from what I wanted
    and knew I could put out. Looking at the good things this summer, I've realized all have happened as I passively
    pick up opportunities that happen to come my way. So, part of my purpose this gap year is to become a more
    passionate person too busy taking on new things to have time to look back and worry if I've wasted time.
<br/><br/>
    It's not like I woke up today and realized I wanted this for myself though. Some variation of it has always lingered
    in my mind for a while now but putting it into words and declaring it to the world is, so I can't back out. It is a
    little late, but today is just around 1 year until I would have to head off to college, so it's a new start to my
    gap year. With my new beginning, I want to put out a few goals I'll shape my life around.
<ol>
    <li>Get in shape and fix my posture</li>
    <li>Read 2 books a month</li>
    <li>Blog daily</li>
    <li>Start contributing to AI research by the end of the year</li>
    <li>Leave the house by February 2025</li>
</ol>
    To all that have read this far, thank you for looking over me, wish me luck, and see you tomorrow.
