<h1>My plan to get fit among other things</h1>
<p>
    To be more specific about my first goal yesterday, when I mean I want to get in shape, I'm thinking of putting on
    upper body and core muscles for once. Doing track and cross-country all four years of high school I've been ignoring
    my parents shaming my lack of arm size and stuff with my pride in my endurance but the summer kind of wiped that, so
    I figured I don't really have an excuse anymore. Also, I'm fairly certain I'm losing to my younger brother on
    upper body strength which is probably my bigger motivator.
    <br/><br/>
    I knew he's already getting exercising in for volleyball, so to catch up I did my research to have every edge
    possible. I made 2 routines, alternating each day, 6 days a week. The first routine is to keep up running endurance
    and to become able to do a bunch of pull-ups (currently at 2 max...). Why design it around pull-ups? Mainly since I
    don't usually have access to a gym but also since it's fun to have some exercise to gauge my improvement over time.
    The second routine is pretty much purely core, it's what my parents shame me the most fore :( I'm also trying to
    include more protein in my diet as well as consuming protein powder and creatine post workouts to build muscle most
    efficiently.
    <br/><br/>
    As I'm writing this the soreness from yesterday's and today's workout hits me each time I lift my arms off the
    keyboard but pain isn't much compared to the feeling of making progress.
    <br/><br/>
    Besides working out, I'm finally trying to find work. I'm looking through a couple of part-time listing sites and
    never in my life have I wished this badly for the younger me to study Japanese harder. A lot of the jobs seem doable
    and the idea of making money is exciting, but then my lack of confidence in Japanese kicks in and welp it seems
    lost. Though at this point, I'm supposed to pay rent to live at home, and I'm going to need money for most gap year
    ideas, so I hope it's a matter of time until my mind realizes the inevitability of getting a job in Japanese and
    stops freaking out about it. Anyway, I hope to soon report of getting my first paycheck (excluding from Tai).
    <br/><br/>
    In yesterday's post, I mentioned how most great things this summer weren't really from me actively organizing them.
    To my own surprise, I'm already going against that habit. I've been figuring out the details for a solo cycling trip
    through the Shimanami Kaido on my way down to my grandparents later this month. Pretty sure this will be the first
    solo trip in my life. It is a fairly popular route so the research is easier but good practice for later adventures
    in the year to come nonetheless.
    <br/><br/>
    The one final update is that I wanted to say I'm 14.69% into <i>one hundred years of solitude</i> which is slightly
    above pace of reading 2 books a month. I'll need to finish the book by the 18th reading 30 pages a day.
    <br/><br/>
    That's all for today. Thanks again and see you tomorrow.
