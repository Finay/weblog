<h1>I have great friends</h1>
<p>
    I don't always remember that, and it's one of those things the statement itself can't remind me of sometimes no
    matter how hard I wish it didn't work this way. At least I always eventually remember. Right now I do, so I hope
    writing will make it last a little longer.
    <br/><br/>
    On another note, I've never been much of a photo taker. I always cite my phone having a bad camera when asked why
    I'm not taking photos at fairly significant occasions. As true as it is that my phone camera sucks, that habit has
    resulted is quite few pieces of evidence to remember events in my life by. So, to get into the habit of getting more
    photos, and to add some flare to this blog, I'll try to also include a photo or two a day.
    <br/><br/>
    Here are todays:
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/first_photo.webp') }}"/>
    Quite random but this is the first thing that came to mind when I wanted to take a photo. It's the bag for a loaf of
    bread I bought (I like bread) with my calendar in the background.
    <br/><br/>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/alain+me_yokai.webp') }}"/>
    I met a friend who lives nearby the night before he leaves for college in the states and finally got a photo at the
    neighborhood park.
