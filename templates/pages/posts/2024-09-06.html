<h1>How much time do I have?</h1>
<p>
    I get 24 hours a day. If I play a day as efficiently as possible, I would wake at 8:00, finish chores, workout, and
    shower by 9:30. Eat breakfast and start working at 9:50. I would get 160 minutes until I eat at 12:30, starting
    again at 13:00. I get 360 minutes until dinner at 19:00. Resuming at 19:40 until I sleep at 23:00 for 200 minutes.
    <br/><br/>
    That's a total of 160 + 360 + 200 = 720 minutes. 12 hours.
    <br/><br/>
    I get 365 days a year. I have 116 days left in 2024. I want to be done with college applications within 85 days.
    I'll have 243 days in 2025 until September. I want to have a part-time job within 25 days.
    <br/><br/>
    When I started writing this I was hoping that the numbers would help me see the gap year better. It didn't. A part
    of me figured this would be the case. There isn't much relief in seeing what may happen in the future. Being mad
    about how I spent the past isn't much of a motivator either.
