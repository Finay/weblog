<h1>Concluding a pretty good week</h1>
<p>
    Today marks one week since my new beginning into this gap year. It also happens to be the 100th day of my gap year.
    What a happy little coincidence.
    <br/><br/>
    Looking back on my week, I'm proud to say it is perfectly aligned towards my destination. I've stuck exactly to my
    workout regimen, I'm 210 pages into my book, I've written every day, I've started my first AI
    experimentation/project, and I'm taking steps to get out into the world.
    <br/><br/>
    As glad as I am about these seven days, I've also noticed a few shortcomings. The last two goals on research and
    setting out are abstract compared to the rest. The first three have already become routines in my daily life and are
    easily measured while I have no clear vision of true success in the other two goals. Additionally, I am losing
    perspective of the greater picture of my gap year and what must be done. With loss of that perspective, it is harder
    to instill into myself a sense of urgency that drives results and developments. Most damaged from this is probably
    my college applications which I am realizing to be much closer than I thought (Well, I guess that's what happens
    when you take 94 days to wake up to your own gap year).
    <br/><br/>
    Going into my second week, I'm adding the 6th goal of having an intentional college application process. Part of
    this goal is to spend an undisturbed hour each day for working on my application. However, the goal itself is also
    abstract like the aforementioned two. For these three abstract goals, I'll try to make these more measurable by
    declaring ambitious milestones with deadlines for each of them as I work towards the goal. I'll post the first set
    of milestones in the next post. Hopefully with these changes in place, I'll be able to live a second week just as
    exciting as the first.
    <br/><br/>
    Finally, I'll go into more detail in tomorrow's post but today was my first day as a TA to a mini class at the Tokyo
    Technical College, a vocational school in Nakano.

    I accidentally noted the 8th as the 100th on my calendar which completely ruined the clean and mistakeless feel I
    proudly had going. (Note to self, remember to take photos throughout the day... those are more interesting)
