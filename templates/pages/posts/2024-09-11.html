<h1>Proof I can get back up</h1>
<p>
    Everyday is a battle of sorts. Fighting your own impatience, impulses from desire, and mental fog.
    <br/><br/>
    Today, I was whooped. Like, feet swept from under me and landing upside down kind of whooped. The TTC class was
    going on remotely today, so I had the whole day to myself. With my revised goals and milestones, there is a lot to
    do and today was my chance to do it. It started falling apart with me sleeping in past my alarm. I neglected
    the habits I built over the past 8 days and deadlines I set for myself didn't mean anything. On the bright side, I
    did get back onto my feet, though, it took until 2am. Everyone in my family was asleep, still in my pajamas that I
    woke up in 18 hours ago, I put on my flip-flops and got outside for the first time today.
    <br/><br/>
    I didn't take a very long walk, maybe around 8 minutes, but it gave me enough clarity to know I had to finish my
    workout and blog for today. Yes, it was 2 in the morning, and for my physical health it was probably stupid thing to
    do, but I knew that the worst thing about losing a day as I did today is the faith I lose in myself and my systems.
    Because if I have so little control over myself that I can waste a day like this after working so hard not to, I
    can't help but question if I truly care about what I say are my values and goals.
    <br/><br/>
    But at the end of the day, though it may have kept me up till 4:30,  I did work out, and I did write this post. My
    tiredness and this writing are proof I can get back up. And although the fact I got up doesn't guarantee anything
    about achieving my aspirations, it sure is better than guaranteeing I won't by giving up.
