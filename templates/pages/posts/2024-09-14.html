<h1>Calluses</h1>
<p>
    The easiest way for me to count the days since the second start to my gap year is with which workout I do that day.
    I alternate between arms and core six times a week, resting on the seventh. All I need to remember is which workout
    I did yesterday, usually evident from where I feel the sorest, and if today is a core day, I know I am an even
    number of days into my week, if today is an arms day, I know I am an odd number of days into my week. Today, I did
    pull-ups, fifth day of the second week, day twelve.
    <br/><br/>
    It's the sixth time I've done my pull-ups' workout, and it's showing on my hands with blisters and calluses forming
    below my fingers on the ridge of my palms. As painful as they are while I hold onto the bar, beyond those moments,
    I can't find a more literal reminder that you become tougher and more resistant to your challenges through facing
    them.
    <br/><br/>
    I like to think my mind, like my hands, is gaining calluses to my resistence to putting my thoughts and state of
    mind into words, to the urges towards excessive stimulation, to the discomfort from the heat and pain of working
    out. And I wish finding evidence of my perseverance within my mind, something to tell me I'm getting stronger, was
    as simple as looking down at a few darker patches of skin on my hands.

    Need I write a caption for this?
