<h1>Two days to departure</h1>
<p>
    It feels like I avoided showing off my progres for a while now, and well, I have. Pretty sure a part of that is
    because I'm not exactly proud of the amount of progress I've made these past few days but life has been moving
    along, and I've had enough disappointment in myself this week, so I'll just dump all the good happenings that I
    haven't mentioned. On Thursday, I barely slept four hours but had a solid day catching up with some friends I
    haven't seen in a while then I got myself to work out and even read extra to make up for missing Wednesday. Friday
    concluded the hackathon/course with TTC and I got to see the finished projects of the four teams. I was glad to see
    many of the students enjoyed the exposure to new concepts they got through my challenge. I also renovated the blog
    to include a logs page for a brief rundown of my activities each day. Yesterday I got my room cleaned and made a
    commitment to do activities like reading seated up instead of lying down. Speaking of reading, as of this morning,
    I'm 31 pages from the end of the book, and I realized I'm ahead of schedule. When I first calculated how many pages
    I would need to read a day to finish it in 15 days, I rounded the 28.2 to 30 pages for simplicity. As a result, I'll
    finish in 14 days, yay! Though out of chronological order, I ended up applying for a one time gig as intended for my
    plan to start making money, but I ended up backing out for the annoying amount of paperwork for something I was
    realistically doing once. I also got the train tickets to head down to the start of the Shimanami Kaido. It really
    doesn't feel like I'll be cycling across islands down in Shikoku in 2 days, but I'm sure the excitement will catch
    up to me by then. I just hope the weather stays nice.
