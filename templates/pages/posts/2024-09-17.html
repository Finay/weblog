<h1>Shimanami Day 1: A day full of things I shoulda taken photos of</h1>
<p>
    I woke up at 5:20 to my alarm, or at least my mind did. My eyes took until Space Cowboy by Jamiroquai finished
    playing. In hindsight, I did set my alarm a little too early as I had time to finish a logic problem a friend sent
    before I packed my computer and other final items. I was out the door walking backwards to wave to my Mom by 6:00,
    a few minutes behind my plan to get to Shinagawa by 6:40, which was still well before the 7:03 I saw in the express
    train confirmation email.
    <br/><br/>
    With one transfer onto the Yamanote line at Shibuya, I made it to Shinagawa at 6:50. Thinking I made good time, I
    check the confirmation email to see when the train I should get on leaves. 7:37. Turns out, the 7:03 was the time I
    should leave Shinjuku in order to make the 7:37... I made too good time. I didn't have the patience to wait the 47
    minutes, so I just got on the next express with the same one I was meant to get on. I find a seat in the unreserved
    section and as I put my stuff down as the announcement comes on with the stops this train makes. That's when I
    learned the only difference between the Nozomi 7 and the Nozomi 11 is that they take slightly different routes after
    Okayama station, one stop before the Fukuyama I'm supposed to get off at. Welp, at least I'm going the right way.
    <br/><br/>
    Totally scared me for a second but wasn't a big deal at all in the end and got to transfer at Shin-Osaka. Something
    about the abandoned feel of having so much concrete going on for hundreds of meters without a person in sight while
    announcements are made in the distance from speakers probably unchanged since the 90s reminded me of Neon Genesis
    Evangelion.

    The view of the ocean as I stepped out of the station finally made it sink in that I was on vacation. (Thinking in
    hindsight that a photo then would have been useful for the blog). As I picked up the bicycle I reserved, I tried to
    get a little more used to speaking Japanese by asking the staff what spots they recommend for lunch near there.
    Although it totally felt like they were talking as if I was an international tourist practicing Japanese (well,
    almost true) I got the greatest random restaurant rec (R^3) of my life. The staff suggested an Italian restaurant,
    aptly named "The Restaurant", within a shop complex in a renovated warehouse called U2. As the staff recommended it,
    he joked about their 5000 yen course meal, so I entered somewhat skeptical if I could afford any meal there, but
    they had a 1500yen pasta with salad buffet set. I got a seat with a view of the ocean, the whole atmosphere was on
    point, the food was exquisite and affordable (especially for a buffet). Twas all sailing too smoothly.
