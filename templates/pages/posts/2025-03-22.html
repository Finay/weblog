<h1>(SEAT2025) I am the silly tourist</h1>
<p>
    that bought a khaen from a souvenir shop in Luang Prabang, Laos. For those of you that don't know, the khaen is a lao/northern thai
    instrument. I think it counts as a organ or smtn. How I ended up with one on my hands goes back to day 1 in chiang
    mai where I saw an ocarina being sold at the night bazaar. A part of me was tempted but I didn't take the leap. And
    at every market after that, I had been regretting that decision because how cool would it be to return home from a
    one month trip with the ability to play some tunes. So, on the night of the 19 after seeing someone play the khaen,
    I knew I was gonna buy the next one I find. Pro tip, don't do that and actually research. The next day (20th), I
    walked into a souvenir shop, and saw an 8 pipe khaen for 950,000 kip and a 7 pipe for 850,000 kip. I picked up a
    7 piper (cuz like, I didn't wanna full send on an instrument I saw a day ago) and bargained the price down to
    680,000 kip (like 5k JPY). Did I get a good deal? not at all, but I now had 14 bamboo pipes :) (cuz 7 on each side,
    just look at the photos I don't care to explain why I called it a 7 pipe one).

    So I get back to my hostel and try playing it a little. Of course I tried it out at the shop and it sounded fine but
    there was one little problem. It's an instrument you exhale AND inhale through. And I only tested exhaling at the
    shop (cuz like I didn't really know better). And inhaling made this horrible dissonant sound without any holes
    pressed (it's supposed to be silent). Welp, it's probably my poor technique, I thougt, I hoped, I prayed. A good 20
    minutes of trying and research later, I was nowhere. No technique consistently avoids the leaking sound and research
    proved interesting (for example, I realized the C written on the top of my khaen probably didn't indicate it was
    tuned to a C scale but instead was a grade C khaen...).
    <br/><br/>
    I spent an hour practicing and testing by the riverside that night and it kinda only confirmed my fears. But, I had
    a plan, well actually, I had multiple:<br/>
    PLAN A. Fix it. How hard could it be, its just some bamboo and insect secreted resin right?
    PLAN B. Learn circular breathing. If I don't ever inhale, I avoid the problem entirely.
    <br/>
    Soap (not typo, I like saying this over "so"). The next day, after a jewelry making class, I spend the afternoon
    taking apart my khaen. Not too many online resources (in english at least...) but goats like jonny olsen came
    through with a few tutorials. Though they weren't for my specific problem... Sadly, a few rounds of taking out every
    pipe and putting it back together didn't solve my problem :(

    For the rest of the night, as I walked around town, I constantly practiced blowing air with my mouth as I inhale
    with my nose in an attempt to learn circular breathing. I felt I made some progress but it really was hard to tell
    and before I got far with that, I started Plan C: To find a person who can help me.
    <br/>
    Next morning, after a fruitless search for an instrument repair shop (cuz like english searches get absolutely
    nothing for my niche little predicament), I called the little theater where I first saw the khaen played. The guy
    told me the one person who could fix a khaen in luang prabang passed away and my best shot was in Vientienne. RIP.
    That wasn't gonna stop me tho. Another hour of riverside khaen tinkering gave me my PLAN D: to return the khaen to
    the same shop and get a working one.

    I kinda scuffedly reattached the bamboo ties and headed back to the shop with my new strat and knowledge. This time,
    I had a better idea on how to test a khaen, was 80% sure the letter on the top indicated the khaens' quality and it
    was just a matter of whether they let me swap it. A quick google translated exchange later, I negotiated an exchange
    where I pay 200,000 kip to get an 8 piper I had checked worked well. The funniest bit of the interaction was
    probably how the lady this time insisted the 7 piper started at 700,000 kip (instead of 850,000 like last time) so I
    need to pay more for the upgrade. Never had I been in a situation where the store negotiates the price down and I
    have to argue it up like that. Anyways, I walk out with my new instrument and my quest for a decent khaen is
    complete. I ditched the paper wrap for the khaen at the store this time and I can really feel the stares from locals
    but I was too occupied to care about that as I walked. I get back to my riverside spot and resume my training from a
    virtual jonny olsen. A few nearby workers even started conversing with me because of the khaen and that was really
    cool. After a good few hours, I was still very crap at it, but I can do a scale and stuff and know a modified
    version of low-key gliding. Probably a few more months before I can make any decent sound but I am quite very
    satisfied. Wish me luck with my training :)
