<h1>log003: Whipped</h1>

2024.05.04 2:07 pm. Holy shit. I just looked back at my week. I keep track of what I spend every 10 minute increment of
my time on. 170 of those chunks in the past week were spent slacking. damn it. If I could completely remove such
instances, I would have had an additional 28.3 hours to my week. At this rate, I spend 10 years of my life like that.
This is why I hate myself.

2024.05.04 10:11 pm. Since 2 pm, I actually got shit done. I finally started my long delayed job search and my
conclusion is that it may not be the way to go. It was interesting seeing what's out there but the specific work I want
to be doing, AI research, seems a little far-fetched at my current skill level. I could try to get some SWE type
internship, but its value compared to simply studying AI might be low. Also, from my search, I'm realizing how
stupid I am. I thought I was on the decent side of CS at ASIJ, then I saw some past grads. They're really impressive
and seeing that, it demotivates the part of me that pursues "names" and as a result motivates the part of me that wants
to catch up (Rewording this, I'm realizing I'm delusional to think I can or should land job positions and that I need
to simply get smarter first). Hopefully, I can contact some of them too which would be fun. Aside from these thoughts,
I'm also thinking about how stupid school is at this point. There are so many things that are so pointless compared to
what I could be doing its crazy. Pretty sure I should study for APs though. That's the plan for the next week I guess.
One final thing, I hope I can make a less scuffed post soon with actual non-fragmented content.
